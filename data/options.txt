# This is the options file.  It works similarly to keymap.txt: the format is
# <option name> <option value>
# <option value> may be any number, positive or negative.  If you use a
# negative sign, do not put a space between it and the number.
#

#
# If you want to restore the default options, simply delete this file.
# A new options.txt will be created next time you play.
